These climate surfaces are novel, in that the weather stations (n = 69) used in their development have rarely been made available or incorporated into contemporary climate products. Multiple calibration methods are provided for maximum and minimum temperature, following the methods described in by Stewart et al. (2017).

Evaluating 3-6 month seasonal climate forecasts for decision-making in farm case studies using APSIM,https://data.csiro.au/dap/ws/v2/collections/53568,Data,53568,"This data consists of APSIM v7.10 model set ups and weather files used to simulate crop production under usual practice and in response to the 3 and/or 6 month seasonal climate forecasts at 8 different case study farms. Case studies were from individual farms in the grains (including cotton), sugarcane, and rice  industries in Australia (farm managers deidentified). The model setups include any modified xml files to better represent crops and other modules). The weather files include historical records obtained from the SILO data base for the nearest weather station to the farms (modified by radiation sourced from Senaps data source), 'perfect' forecasts calculated from the historical record, and seasonal climate forecasts generated from the Access-S2 and ECMWF general circulation models."
"Climate-based ensemble predictions and uncertainty metrics (TAI, TSD) for plant species in Victoria, southeast Australia (38) and the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan (12)",https://data.csiro.au/dap/ws/v2/collections/53962,Data,53962,"This collection includes each of the climate variables (across multiple source datasets), presence and absence records, associated plant species distributions in Victoria (n=38) and Bhutan (n=12), and ensemble metrics generated as part of the manuscript titled 'Predicting plant species distributions using climate-based model ensembles with corresponding measures of congruence and uncertainty' (Stewart et al. under review). 

Ensembles are calculated using modelled predictions of species distributions that have been fitted using alternative source climate datasets (n = 10). Each contributing surface represents an ensemble of 7 algorithms (artificial neural networks, boosted regression trees, random forests, generalised additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, classification tree analysis, and flexible discriminant analysis). The ensemble metrics presented include the Threshold Agreement Index (TAI; describes the degree to which model predictions agree with respect to an optimal classification threshold) and the Threshold-scaled Standard Deviation (TSD; the standard deviation across all predictions in the ensemble, penalised in regions where contributing models agree with respect to an optimal classification threshold). These metrics describe the congruence and uncertainty associated with the selection of alternative climate datasets; however, could be applied to other applications (e.g. niche overlap under climate change, alternative algorthms, etc.). These metrics are each calculated, per-pixel, using 10 contributing prediction surfaces.

Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project. Climate - Historical Climate Data Scenario (partial),https://data.csiro.au/dap/ws/v2/collections/34349,Service,34349,"CSIRO, through the Water for a Healthy Country National Research Flagship, was contracted by the National Water Commission to assess the current and future water availability in 18 regions across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) considering climate change and other risks to water resources.   Three climate scenarios were used for the hydrological modelling in the project: historical climate, recent climate and future climate. The historical climate scenario, is the baseline against which other scenarios are compared.  This dataset is used to run rainfall-runoff models and is based on observed SILO Drill climate data from 1895-2006.  The original SILO data has been removed due to licensing restrictions.  The areal potential evapotranspiration (APET) and point potential evapotranspiration (PPET) were both derived.
